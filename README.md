With it's AI Agent it doesn't sugarcoat things but rather nudges you towards the right track and if need be suggests alterations to your goals.

### A bit about this project
This started off as a personal project to create a data tracking app personalised to my specifications (one I didn't have to pay for) and to get to grasps with common frameworks like React and Next as well as understanding imlpementations of APIs, auth, caches and database management/querying. In general just learning how to build a project from the ground up with a tech stack.
