# OwnMi

**OwnMi** allows you to take **own**ership of your future.

At it's core it is a focus tracking app providing long term analytics and visualisations of your performance not just in your study but anything quantifiable.

[Have a look at the technical details.](https://prajyakha.com/technical-breakdown)


## Features
**Track things such as:**

- Total Time spent
- Events completed
- Progress towards goals

**Visualisations include:**

- Heatmaps for consistency
- Bar Charts and Line Graphs for long term analysis

With it's AI Agent it doesn't sugarcoat things but rather nudges you towards the right track and if need be suggests alterations to your goals.

### A bit about this project
This started off as a personal project to create a data tracking app personalised to my specifications (one I didn't have to pay for) and to get to grasps with common frameworks like React and Next as well as understanding imlpementations of APIs, auth, caches and database management/querying. In general just learning how to build a project from the ground up with a tech stack.
